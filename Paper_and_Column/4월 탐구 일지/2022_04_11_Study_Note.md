- Chain : the state that each block cryptographically references its parent
    - data cannot be changed without chaning all subsequent blocks
- Nodes : computers that are composing chain network
- PoW : Proof-of-Work, consensus mechanism (a way to maintain distributed agreement)

    - How : Solving the puzzle proves of the work that using computational resources
