### [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) : A standard for NFT

ERC 721 defines that Non-fungible 'token' is being different by having own ID : token ID.

To understand ERC-721 deeply, I had to study prerequisites that were suggested by the writer of the column :
- [Self-Study notes on Accounts]()
- [Self-Study notes on Smart Contracts]()
- [Self-Study notes on Token standards]() <br>

And also those prerequisites are requiring these terms :
- [Self-Study notes on Transactions]()
- [Self-Study notes on Ethereum Virtual Machine]() <br>
